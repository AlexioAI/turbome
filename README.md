## What is a `spoon.me` file?

`spoon.me` files are SpoonScripts that contain instructions to automatically package applications. By
convention, packaging scripts are named `spoon.me` and placed in the root of a repository.

Spoon containers can be shared on the [Spoonium.net](http://spoonium.net) online hub and deployed
to end users on the [Spoon.net](http://spoon.net) application hosting service.
