Creating a workspace for controlup tools. Thus far my testing of the ControlUp Agent has been a failure. I spoke with Trond about how he uses
the tool, as it seems like the management peice will only pick up on agents pushed centrally. I plan to have a call with ControlUp to speak further.

The Console appears to work.
